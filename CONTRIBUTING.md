# How to contribute to this repository

First of all: Thanks for considering a contribution. Every kind of contribution is welcome. I try to respond to them as quickly as possible. Expect a response in average after 2 days or latest after 1 week (if not on vacation).

## You have a feature idea

If you have new feature ideas, please check out existing issues first, if an issue exists already. Feel free to thumb up the issue, if you agree or comment for more information. If no issue exists, please open one and explain what feature you would want and why. I'll get to that as soon as possible. Please create a feature issue first before opening a pull request, so that we can ensure, it fits into this repository. It would be sad to waste your time, if for some reason, I do not see the feature as being part of this repo. Please prefix feature idea issue with "Feature:"

## You found a bug

Please create an issue if you found a bug and this bug does not exist yet in the issues. Feel free to also provide a pull request, if you want and can fix it yourself. Please prefix bug issues with "Bug:"

## You have a question

If you have any questions about the repo, please open an issue with the prefix "Question:". This can then be a sign, that I should update the documentation.

## You want to contribute with a pull request

Pull requests are welcome. Please make sure, that an issue exists first. Please comment in the issues, if you are planning to provide a pull request for that. For features, as already mentioned, it makes sense to agree on adding them first before putting in work. Please reference the issue ID in the branch name for the pull request. And please use [Conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). You can omit the "scope".

Thank you so much for helping to make this tool better üëèüëè
